Composite Field Mapping Example.pdf - an example showing the matrices used to map
between GF(2^8) and GF(((2^2)^2)^2).

wldnrpt.pdf - a 1995 report by professor E J Weldon Jr, explaining inversion (1/x)
of elements GF(2^8) via mapping to GF((2^4)^2), doing the inversion algebra,
and mapping back.
